    <img src="public/img/tinify-2022-11-16T16_29_27/image1.webp" class="img_1" alt="Robert T.kiyosaki">
    <p>I present to you the book of Robert T.kiyosaki called “rich father , poor father” the book appeared in 1997 it is made known 7 years later and became a best-seller in terms of personal finance. Robert wrote this autobiography to sensitize parents and people who want to get out of poverty.When you look for a book that deals with the same subject you often see this book coming out as a very good book to start creating a book <a href="emplacement en.html"> mindset</a> The book is autobiographical but it is told in a very immersive way with dialogue between him his rich father , his poor father .</p>

    </div>
    <p> It is in the course of history that we understand the same lesson as Robert in his childhood, the narrative moments are quite dynamic because
        it is often cut by a quotation from his rich father or an explanatory graphic of a notion introduced in the page.
        If I have to give you a defect I would say that it is relatively repetitive but it allows us to understand the concepts and not to find it again
       He doesn’t understand anything. It and very simple to read there are not many very specific words and if there are , the book puts you in the same situation
       that robert is a child who knows no term.The book also offers us moments of introspection or the author breaks the 4th wall and asks the reader questions,
        This is a very good way to know if you have understood and learned the lessons that precede the questionnaire.
       I personally agreed on many written lessons, the times when I disagreed were rare.
       I strongly advise it for anyone who wants to understand how you have to think every day to succeed financially
